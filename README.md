# How to Code? - Deep Learning
This repository is a part of 100 days Deep Learning Challenge, started from 18 February 2021. It will have range of projects right from developing a neural network from scratch using python, to using different architectures, frameworks and diving deep into Deep Learning and covering Convolution Neural Network, Sequence Model and Audio Processing related projects. 

## Dataset
</br>
There's a separate folder for datasets where all the data set I will using throughout my project will be stored and can be easily accessed.

## Daily Work Report
</br>
Day 1 - Used basic Python and Maths to cover topics : Forward and Backward Propogation , Optimization
</br>
</br>
Automatic Text Generation -  This uses LSTM, Keras and Tensorflow to automatically Generate Texts. Currently its been trained on epochs = 1 to reduce the training time. It includes Data Collection, Text Preprocessing, Tokenisation, Seeding, Building LSTM Model and Generating text function.
